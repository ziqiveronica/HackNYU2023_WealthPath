# HackNYU2023_WealthPath
Here are some features we are planning to implement using Matlab, Twilio, Velo, and Hedera for our WealthPath project :
Matlab: We can use Matlab to develop and implement financial models that help users make informed investment decisions. For example, we can use machine learning algorithms to analyze market trends and provide personalized investment recommendations to users.
Twilio: We can integrate Twilio's SMS API to send users personalized financial alerts, such as updates on their investment portfolio performance, reminders to pay bills, or notifications of suspicious account activity.
Velo: We can use Velo to develop a mobile application version of WealthPath, making it even more accessible to users on-the-go. We can also use Velo's database integration capabilities to securely store user data and ensure that their personal financial information is protected.
Hedera: We can use Hedera's blockchain technology to create a decentralized financial marketplace where users can securely exchange assets, such as cryptocurrency or non-fungible tokens (NFTs), without intermediaries. This could potentially expand the financial services available to users and promote financial inclusion.
These are just a few examples of how we can leverage the technologies provided by MLH sponsors to enhance WealthPath and provide more value to our users.



Here is some sample code that we are planning to run in the matlab for our project WealthPath for analyzing financial data:


% Load financial data from a CSV file
data = readtable('financial_data.csv');

% Compute the mean return over a given period
mean_return = mean(data.Return);

% Compute the standard deviation of returns over a given period
std_dev = std(data.Return);

% Compute the Sharpe ratio
risk_free_rate = 0.02;
sharpe_ratio = (mean_return - risk_free_rate) / std_dev;

% Visualize the data using a histogram
histogram(data.Return, 'Normalization', 'pdf');
title('Distribution of Returns');
xlabel('Returns');
ylabel('Probability Density');

% Save the Sharpe ratio to a text file
fid = fopen('sharpe_ratio.txt', 'wt');
fprintf(fid, 'Sharpe Ratio: %.2f\n', sharpe_ratio);
fclose(fid);
